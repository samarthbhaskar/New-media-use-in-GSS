This repository contains public code from my MA thesis at the University of Chicago in the Master of Arts Program in the Social Sciences (MAPSS).

The majority of other code I have written (SQL, Python, R) is currently under property of Obama for America. As the election season draws to a close, I will be able to put more code here for public view. In the meantime, please excuse the emptiness of my Github account.
